DialogueSystem has 
<NpcID>, <DialogueID>, <BranchID>, <ProgressionID>
NpcID for who speaks
DialogueID for what conversation will start
BranchID for second answer branching conversation 
ProgressionID for where is it in the conversation

DialogueSystem fills the dialogues

CharacterStats will contain the character save states like:
Quest completed (If quest is completed, dialogue ignores it and move to next)
Story completed (If story is completed it starts on incomplete story)
Conditional States <boolean> (for values like gate block entry, river crossing pass)

This will be saved in a .Json as a save state
